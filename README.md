# The Multivariate AnalysiS Applications for Microbial Ecology (MASAME)

The apps in this directory will allow you to perform a set of statistical
analysis and screens typically suited to ecological data sets. These accompany an online guide to statistical analysis in microbial ecology, available here: http://mb3is.megx.net/gustame

## Example data sets

Please find demo data sets in the "Example data sets" directory. These
are correctly formatted for upload to MASAME Apps under the default
upload settings. More information is available in the README file in 
the directory.
